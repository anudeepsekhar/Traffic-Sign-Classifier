# Traffic Sign Classifier Project

## Overview
This project is my submission for the Self Driving Car Nano Degree Program, I have used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I have trained trained a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, I have then tested the model program on new images of traffic signs you find on the web. The code used and the relusts are presented in this repository.


## Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

 - Jupyter
 - NumPy
 - OpenCV
 - SciPy
 - scikit-learn
 - TensorFlow
 - Matplotlib
 - Pandas (Optional)
 
 ## Jupyter Notebook
